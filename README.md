## Completed Tasks

### 1. Web Development
- **Main Interface (`index.html`)**: Built a sleek, single-page layout featuring a dynamic greeting, current time display, and professional sections (About, Skills, Projects).
- **Styling (`style.css`)**: Implemented a "Glassmorphism" design system using CSS variables, smooth gradients, and micro-animations for a premium look and feel.
- **Dynamic Features**: Added JavaScript to handle real-time clock updates and responsive interactions.

### 2. Git & GitHub Integration
- **Local Initialization**: Initialized a new Git repository in the `L1-PersonalPage` directory.
- **Privacy Protection**: Identified and resolved a GitHub push rejection caused by email privacy settings. 
- **Noreply Configuration**: Configured the project to use the GitHub-provided noreply email (`16698007+huanchen1107@users.noreply.github.com`) to ensure privacy without blocking deployments.
- **Successful Deployment**: Pushed the entire codebase to the remote repository: [https://github.com/huanchen1107/0225DRL_DIC1.git](https://github.com/huanchen1107/0225DRL_DIC1.git).

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Core structure and content.
- `style.css`: Visual design and animations.
- `README.md`: This project documentation.

## Future Recommendations
- Add more personal project showcases to the 'Projects' section.
- Integrate a contact form or social media links.
- Consider deploying the site via GitHub Pages for public access.
